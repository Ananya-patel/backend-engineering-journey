## Day 39 – Java Memory Model & Happens-Before

### Key Learnings
- Java Memory Model defines visibility and ordering guarantees
- Happens-before ensures writes by one thread are visible to others
- synchronized, volatile, start(), join() establish happens-before
- Correct concurrent code relies on memory guarantees, not assumptions

### Hands-on
- Reasoned about visibility and ordering using happens-before rules
