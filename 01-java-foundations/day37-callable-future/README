## Day 37 – Callable & Future

### Key Learnings
- Callable returns a result and can throw exceptions
- Future represents pending async computation
- future.get() blocks until result is ready
- Async exceptions are wrapped in ExecutionException

### Hands-on
- Executed multiple Callables using ExecutorService
- Retrieved results using Future
