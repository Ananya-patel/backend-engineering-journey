### Key Learnings
- Threads move through defined lifecycle states
- sleep() pauses the current thread temporarily
- join() allows one thread to wait for another
- Thread execution order is not guaranteed without coordination

### Hands-on
- Demonstrated sleep() and join() with worker and main threads
