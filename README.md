# Backend Engineering Journey (Google-Scale)

This repository documents my end-to-end journey of becoming a 
production-grade backend engineer, starting from absolute zero 
and progressing toward Google-level backend engineering.

## Focus Areas
- Java & JVM internals
- Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)
- Spring & Spring Boot
- Databases & persistence
- Distributed systems & scalability
- System design & Google interview preparation

## Engineering Principles
- Clean code over clever code
- Design for scale, even in small systems
- Strong testing culture
- Clear documentation & tradeoff analysis

## Repository Structure
Each folder represents a distinct learning phase and includes:
- Theory notes
- Hands-on implementations
- Tests
- Design documentation
